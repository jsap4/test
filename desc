Welcome to Find The Invisible Link!

This is a blatant rip-off of Find The Invisible Cow, only this time, it's much more stupid :)


How to play:

PC (easy mode) - Move your mouse around until you hover over the link, and then click.
Mobile (hard mode) - Click in random spots on the screen and hope you find it.


Difficulties:

Easy - 250x250 pixel grid where the link can appear.
Normal - 500x500 pixels.
Hard - 750x750 pixels.
Expert - 1000x1000 pixels. The hardest mode you can still have fun with.
Insane - 10000x10000 pixels. You'll be doing a lot of scrolling.
Impossible - 1000000x1000000 pixels. Don't even bother with this one.


Why this exists:

I got bored and made it one day. Then it became April 1st so I decided to upload it.
